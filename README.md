# Ultra Bungee Website Project
Starter code for the Ultra Bungee project. 
After you accept this assignment, you will be working in your own copy (fork) of this repo.

**Submission** - you should **commit changes to your repo regularly**. At least once per session.  
This will ensure that you have a record of regular contributions to show your progress!

## Task Description
You will be building the Ultra Bungee website, using the content and images supplied. The page will have:
- navigation bar with hyperlinks, to move between the pages
- home page with general info
- a page for each of the different jumps
- image gallery / lightbox, using a JQuery Fancybox
- a contact page, with a contact form

## Resources
- Images: you will find full size and thumbnail versions of most images. The thumbnails are used to make the image gallery.
- Text copy: see txt file for some of the written content

## To Do:
- The **index.html** file will be the home page for the website. **Start with that page**
- Edit the **style.css** sheet to edit the page layout and styling
- **TIP:** start with the header / navigation bar
- Once the home page is done, create the other pages, e.g. bridge.html, gallery.html etc.
- **Reuse common page elements** - e.g. the header / navigation elements will be used on all pages
- Don't forget to include a **stylesheet link** in the <head> element of each html page, so that the stylesheet will be applied
- For this project, you can use the one stylesheet to style all of the pages
